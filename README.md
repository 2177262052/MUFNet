# MUF-Net: A Novel Self-Attention Based Dual-Task Learning Approach for Automatic Left Ventricle Segmentation in Echocardiography

In this study, we propose a novel self-attention-based dual-task learning approach 8 for automatic left ventricle segmentation.

## Getting Started
if you want to train:
```
python train_new.py
```
If you want to test individual model weights：
```
run cs_weight.py
```
If you want to test calculated ESV and EDV
```
run test_only_new.py
run calculate_diff.py
```
If you want to visualize，

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

/```
Give the example
/```

And repeat

/```
until finished
/```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

/```
Give an example
/```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

/```
Give an example
/```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
